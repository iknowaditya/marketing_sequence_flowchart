# Email Marketing Sequence - MERN Stack Project

This project involves designing and implementing an **Email Marketing Sequence** using a **visual flowchart interface**. It leverages the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and provides a way for users to visually create and manage email sequences for marketing purposes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a web-based application where users can design email marketing workflows using a visual flowchart. Users will be able to set triggers, conditions, and actions for their email sequences. The system will automate the process of sending emails at predefined intervals based on user configurations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (with flowchart UI integration)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer (for email sending)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access

## Features

1. **Visual Flowchart Editor**:
   - Users can drag and drop elements to create email sequences.
   - Support for various actions like sending emails, waiting for a specified time, or conditional branching.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Users must log in or register to manage their email sequences.
   - JWT tokens will be used for secure authentication.

3. **Email Sequence Creation**:
   - Users can create and manage email sequences that include steps like:
     - Sending emails.
     - Conditional steps based on user interaction (e.g., clicks, opens).
     - Time-based actions like waiting for 24 hours before sending the next email.

4. **Email Templates**:
   - Allow users to create and customize email templates that can be used within the email sequences.

5. **Track User Interactions**:
   - Track when an email is sent, when it is opened, and when a user clicks on a link.

6. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Provide analytics and statistics on the performance of email sequences.
   - Track delivery rates, open rates, click rates, etc.

## Steps for Implementation

### Frontend (React)

- Use React to build the UI for the application, with a focus on providing an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating email marketing sequences.
- Use a library such as [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) for building the visual flowchart. This will allow users to drag and connect different steps in their email sequence.
- Implement React Router for page navigation, such as login, dashboard, and email sequence creation.
- Integrate forms for users to input email content, schedule times, and set conditions.

### Backend (Node.js / Express)

- Set up an Express server to handle API requests for user authentication, creating email sequences, and interacting with the database.
- Use **JWT** for authentication and **bcryptjs** for password hashing.
- Implement CRUD operations for email sequences: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
- Integrate **Nodemailer** to handle the actual sending of emails via SMTP.
- Set up routes for interacting with the frontend, e.g., for saving email sequences and fetching user data.

### Database (MongoDB)

- Use MongoDB to store user information, email templates, and email sequences.
- Set up collections for:
  - **Users**: Store user credentials and authentication data.
  - **Email Sequences**: Store the visual flow of the email sequence.
  - **Email Templates**: Store reusable email templates that can be applied to sequences.
  - **User Interactions**: Track email sent/opens/clicks for analytics.

### Email Sending Logic (Nodemailer)

- Use **Nodemailer** to send emails. The backend should communicate with an SMTP server (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, etc.).
- Include logic to send emails based on triggers and timing defined by the user in the flowchart.

### Admin Dashboard (React)

- Create a dashboard where users can see their created email sequences, view their performance (e.g., number of emails sent, open rates, etc.), and modify sequences.
- Implement a statistics and analytics page to visualize the success of each email sequence.

## Example Data Models

### User Model (MongoDB)

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  emailSequences: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'EmailSequence' }]
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
